# Calendar Application - Documentation

## Overview
This application is a command line based calendar system capable of creating and editing events, querying events by date, and exporting them to CSV. It supports both **interactive** and **headless** modes, handling user commands to manage and organize calendar events.

## Code Flow

1. **CalendarApp (Main Entry Point)**
    - Instantiates the core `CalendarController`.
    - Invokes `modeFactory.getMode()` to select the appropriate mode.
    - Calls `mode.execute()` to begin program execution
   
2. **ModeFactory**
   - `getMode` parses a string and returns an implementation of the `Mode` interface

3. **CalendarController**
    - Maintains a reference to the core `Calendar` model.
    - Provides methods for:
        - Creating single or recurring events (timed or all-day).
        - Editing existing events (single or multiple).
        - Querying events (on a date, between dates, or checking busy status).
        - Exporting events to CSV.
    - Interprets the user's chosen mode (interactive or headless) and delegates to the appropriate processing method (`processInteractive` or `processHeadless`).

4. **CommandFactory**
    - Is responsible for parsing an input string and returning and implementation of the `Command` interface
    - The returned `Command` implementation and execute the command by calling `Command.execute()`

5. **Model Classes**
    - **Calendar**:
        - Stores and manages `Event` objects (e.g. conflict checks, add/edit methods, CSV export).
    - **Event** (interface):
        - Basic event behaviors (getters for name, time, location, etc.).
    - **AbstractCalendarEvent**:
        - Shared fields (name, start/end times, description, location, and public flag).
    - **SingleEvent**:
        - A single, non-recurring event.
    - **RecurringEvent**:
        - Generates multiple instances (`SingleEvent`) based on specified weekdays and either an occurrence count or an until date/time.

6. **Exceptions**
    - **InvalidCommandException**: Thrown when an unrecognized or invalid command is encountered.
    - **InvalidTokenException**: Thrown when a required token (like `to`) is missing.
    - **MissingParameterException**: Thrown when a required parameter is absent (e.g., event name, date/time).

## Input Command Workflow

### Interactive Mode
1. **Startup Prompt**  
   The application asks which mode to use:
    - **1** = Interactive
    - **2** = Headless
    - **3** = Exit

2. **If Interactive**
    - Prompts the user to enter commands (e.g., `create event Meeting from 2025-04-01T10:00 to 2025-04-01T11:00 --autodecline`).
    - Reads each command line, then calls `CommandFactory` to parse and the string and return an implementation of the `Command` interface
    - The returned command is executed by calling the `.execute()`
    - This method then calls the appropriate `CalendarController` method(s).
    - Print or display results (e.g., event creation success messages or listing events).
    - Type `exit` to end the interactive session and return to the main mode prompt.

### Headless Mode
1. **Startup Prompt**
    - **2** = Headless
    - The application asks for a file path containing commands.

2. **File-based Commands**
    - Each line in the file is processed sequentially, sending each line to the `CommandFactory`.
    - The `CommandFactory` returns an implementation of the `Command` class
    - This `Command` then executes the command through the `.execute()` method
    - The final `exit` command stops execution.

### Common Commands Examples
- **Create Single Timed Event**  
  `create event Meeting from 2025-04-01T10:00 to 2025-04-01T11:00 --autodecline`
- **Create Single All-Day Event**  
  `create event Vacation on 2025-04-10`
- **Edit Single Event**  
  `edit event description Meeting from 2025-04-01T10:00 to 2025-04-01T11:00 with UpdatedDesc`
- **Print Events on a Date**  
  `print events on 2025-04-01`
- **Show Busy Status**  
  `show status on 2025-04-01T10:30`
- **Export to CSV**  
  `export cal my_calendar.csv`

### Distribution of Work
For this assignment, Achyut primarily worked on implementing the functional parts of the rubric.
Marcus did the refactoring and worked on implementing the factories as well as the testing. 
However, both Marcus and Achyut spent much of the assignment in both in person working sessions and remote working sessions.
